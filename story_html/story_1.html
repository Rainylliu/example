            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I dreamed that I was in a game where I found a treasury
                   with a lot of gold coins. However, this treasury had a 
                   security detail, and I needed to infiltrate the treasury 
                   and steal as much gold coins as possible while they were 
                   changing shifts. 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   I smoothly entered the treasury and happily
                   placed the gold coins into my backpack. As I was getting ready 
                   to leave security came back and I had no choice but to make a 
                   rapid escape. The situation was quite thrilling.</p>
