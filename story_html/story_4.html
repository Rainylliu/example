                <h3>Water-damaged computer</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I dreamed that a glass of water fell down, and the water 
                    splashed on my computer, and the computer screen went 
                    straight black. I immediately realized that my computer 
                    might have been compromised, and that my recent homework 
                    was only half done and had not been saved. I felt a strong 
                    sense of tension and anxiety and was in a very anxious mood.
                    I quickly wiped off the water and tried to save it. However, 
                    despite all my efforts, it still wouldn't start. I hurried out 
                    of the house and went to the nearest computer repair shop.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the staff at the repair shop checked my computer, they 
                    told me it was in bad shape and it could take weeks to fix. 
                    They advised me to consider buying a new computer, but unfortunately 
                    they didn't have the model I needed and I would have to wait at least 
                    two weeks if I wanted to buy one. I was in a very anxious mood because 
                    my homework was due soon.
