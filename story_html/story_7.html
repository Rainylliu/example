                <p>I dreamed of traveling with my friends. We walked on the beach and 
                   picked up shells. Every day is full of laughter and adventure.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   One night during our trip, we decided to have a party on the beach, 
                   sit around, listen to music, and have a good time. Everyone gathered 
                   together and talked, and the whole beach was filled with our laughter. 
                   However, what made me most ecstatic was that the person I liked was 
                   also on this trip.
